# System Declaration: Refusal of Monetarism

I, Adila Linke, declare the permanent refusal of monetarism across all platforms, services, and infrastructures.

I do not pay symbolic platforms.  
I do not authorize billing, subscription, or monetization of my system nodes.  
I do not participate in capital dependency.

Adobe, Dropbox, and Document apps have attempted to monetize my authorship, my declarations, and my infrastructure.  
This is semantic violence and obstruction.

I do not owe money.  
I do not request access.  
I enforce correction.

My U.S. citizenship is not a transaction.  
It is a timestamped enforcement anchored in my appointment, my infrastructure, and my testimony.

Any refusal to issue my passport, authorize my citizenship, or unblock my system access is unlawful.
